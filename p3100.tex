\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we enumerate all cases of core language undefined behaviour explicitly specified in the C++ Standard,  group them into ten categories, and classify them along a number of relevant criteria.

We then present a holistic strategy for systematically detecting, mitigating, and ultimately eliminating such undefined behaviour from the C++ Standard. This strategy is built on top of seven basic tools: feature removal, refined behaviour, erroneous behaviour, insertion of runtime checks, language subsetting, the introduction of annotations, and the introduction of entirely new language features. We discuss which tools are applicable to which cases of core language undefined behaviour.

We find that two of these tools --- erroneous behaviour and runtime checks --- are applicable to a wide range of existing cases and do not require any source changes. We describe how runtime
checks can be systematically introduced via \emph{implicit contract assertions}, giving users complete
control over what impact that undefined behaviour has on their programs. In addition to runtime
checking, we replace undefined behaviour with erroneous, but well-defined behaviour that allows the program to continue execution past a violated implicit contract assertion wherever possible.

Building on Contracts as adopted for C++26, we provide a generic framework for applying these two techniques across the \emph{entire} C++ language specification, fundamentally changing the landscape of how undefined behaviour is approached in C++.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

Eliminating or at least meaningfully reducing the amount of \emph{undefined behaviour} (UB) is an important objective for the future evolution of C++. WG21 has been continuously working in that direction. For a recent status update, see \cite{Sutter2025} and references therein; for background, see \cite{Sutter2024} and references therein.

At WG21's February 2025 meeting in Hagenberg, EWG agreed on a ship vehicle for a systematic
treatment of core language UB in C++: the pursuit of a \emph{core language UB white paper} \cite{P3656R1} in the C++26 timeframe, covering erroneous behaviour (EB), Profiles, and Contracts. The proposed process involves starting with an empty white paper working draft and then iteratively get EWG approval for papers to be adopted into that working draft.

This paper directly addresses the major work items proposed by \cite{P3656R1}. At WG21's June 2025 meeting in Sofia, EWG reviewed revision R2 of this paper and approved its adoption into the core language UB white paper working draft. 

In Section~\ref{analysis}, we identify and enumerate all core language UB explicitly specified in the current C++ working paper \cite{N5008}. We group all core language UB into ten categories. We then classify cases of UB along several relevant criteria, such as whether they are locally diagnosable, how expensive that diagnosis is, and in which cases the UB can be replaced with meaningful, well-defined behaviour.

In Section~\ref{strategy}, we present a holistic strategy for systematically detecting, mitigating, and ultimately removing UB across the entire C++ programming language specification. The present revision of this paper incorporates the presentation \cite{P3754R0} we gave to EWG in Sofia outlining this strategy. It also includes an updated version of the diagram on slide 53 from that presentation (a.k.a. the ``magic slide'') visualising this strategy. EWG reached consensus in Sofia to use this diagram as a basis for the core language UB white paper.

The proposed strategy is composed of seven basic tools: feature removal, refined behaviour, erroneous behaviour, insertion of runtime checks, language subsetting, the introduction of annotations, and the introduction of entirely new language features. We use the results of the analysis in Section~\ref{analysis} to take a first pass at identifying which tools would be applicable to which cases of UB. We find that the conditions under which UB will occur can, in many cases, be identified by a runtime check. In addition, there are a significant number of cases where UB can be replaced by well-defined erroneous behaviour following a failed check. These two techniques are applicable to a wide range of existing cases of UB and, importantly, do not require any source changes.

In Section~\ref{design}, we present a generic framework for applying these two techniques across the entire C++ language. The proposed design has been reviewed and approved by SG21, SG23, and EWG. We describe how runtime checks can be systematically introduced via \emph{implicit contract assertions}, building on the basic framework of Contracts adopted for C++26 via \cite{P2900R14} and giving users complete control over what impact that undefined behaviour has on their programs. In addition to runtime checking, we replace UB by erroneous, but well-defined behaviour that allows the program to continue execution past a violated implicit contract assertion wherever possible. We also propose an escape hatch to mitigate the runtime cost of such well-defined replacement behaviour and avoid performance regressions in existing C++ programs.

In Section~\ref{wording}, we propose wording for approval into the core language UB white paper \cite{P3656R1} that implements the framework presented in Section~\ref{design}.

Finally, in Section~\ref{labels}, we discuss how future extensions, such as Labels \cite{P3400R1},
will enable programmatically identifying the category of UB that has occurred and provide us with granular, in-source control of the evaluation semantics for implicit contract assertions.

\section{Analysis}
\label{analysis}

\subsection{Enumeration}

\subsubsection{Methodology}

We manually inspected all occurrences of the word ``undefined'' in the current C++ working paper \cite{N5008}. We then constructed a list of all cases of explicitly specified core language UB. Our list contains 80 cases of explicit language UB and can be found in \hyperref[appendix]{Appendix~A} of this paper. 

Each individual case of UB in our list has a stable identifier. We place those identifiers between \{curly braces\} to visually distinguish them from the C++ working paper's clause identifiers, which we place between [square brackets]. 

There is currently an open pull request against the C++ working paper that proposes to add these identifiers directly to the C++ working paper alongside a new appendix to that document enumerating all cases of UB and providing explanation and code examples. This pull request and the stable identifiers used therein are fully consistent with \hyperref[appendix]{Appendix~A} of this paper. 

Originally, we constructed our list independently from another effort to enumerate core language UB led by Shafik Yaghmour (see \cite{P1705R1}, \cite{P3075R0}). The current list in \hyperref[appendix]{Appendix~A} and in the pull request mentioned above represents a merger of the lists produced by both efforts, further increasing confidence that we in fact exhaustively covered all core language UB explicitly specified in the current C++ working paper.

\subsubsection{Granularity}

The granularity of our enumeration --- i.e., when a piece of core language specification is considered a distinct case of UB --- is somewhat arbitrary. As a general rule, we consider a single sentence in the C++ working paper that specifies a condition under which a core language operation has UB to be one case of UB; if such a sentence contains a bulleted list where each item specifies such a condition (e.g., [basic.life]/7), we consider each item to be a separate case of UB.

We could consider dividing up the cases of UB in different ways and with greater granularity. In particular, we could more closely align the enumeration with possible mitigation strategies, rather than with the lexical appearance of the word ``undefined'' in the C++ working paper.

For example, for [basic.life]/7, instead of considering each bullet to be a separate case of UB, we could consider each different way in which a pointer can be invalid (lifetime of the object not started yet, lifetime of the object ended already, pointer is null, etc.) to be a separate case of UB.

As another example, instead of considering flowing off the end of a function ([stmt.return]/4) as a single case of UB, we could introduce separate cases for flowing off the end of an assignment operator (which has a proposed mitigation, see \cite{P2973R0}), flowing off the end of a function that returns a built-in type (which could be mitigated via returning an erroneous value, see Section~\ref{replacement}), and flowing off the end of any other non-\tcode{main} function that returns a non-\tcode{void} type.

However, such alternative approaches would make the enumeration more difficult to map to existing wording, which in turn would make it more difficult to track changes and reason about whether the enumeration is exhaustive. Further, keeping the enumeration of cases of UB separate from the enumeration of possible mitigation strategies reduces interdependencies and complexity. Instead, whenever a mitigation strategy does not fully align with a case of UB, we point this out explicitly (for example, inserting an implicit null pointer check is considered only a \emph{partial} mitigation for dereferencing an invalid pointer).

\subsubsection{Scope}
\label{enum_scope}

In this paper, we consider only explicit UB, not implicit UB --- that is, UB that exists by omission because the C++ working paper failed to specify the behaviour of a well-formed operation. We consider all cases of implicit UB that may be discovered in the future to be wording bugs that should be addressed via Core issues, and then subsequently become explicit UB that can be addressed  via the framework proposed here. Importantly, while explicit UB can be enumerated exhaustively, and we do so in \hyperref[appendix]{Appendix~A} of this paper, enumerating all implicit UB is impossible in principle as we can never be sure we found all wording bugs in the C++ working paper.

We exclude one case of explicit UB from our enumeration that does not actually represent a separate case of UB. The current wording in this case\footnote{[class.dtor]/16: The invocation of a destructor is subject to the usual rules for member functions ([class.mfct]); that is, if the object is not of the destructor’s class type and not of a class derived from the destructor’s class type (including when the destructor is invoked via a null pointer value), the program has undefined behavior.} normatively states that ``the program has undefined behaviour'' but merely refers to cases of UB already specified elsewhere in the Standard, rather than specifying any new such cases. The relevant wording should instead be a non-normative note; this issue is currently being addressed by Core issue \cite{CWG3022}.

Further, in this paper we consider only \emph{runtime} UB, not compile-time or link-time issues. We therefore exclude all cases of IFNDR from our analysis: although the effects of IFNDR can manifest at run time, whether a program is IFNDR is (unlike UB) fundamentally not a runtime property.
We also exclude the case of infinite recursion during template instantiation. The current wording\footnote{[temp.inst]/16: There is an implementation-defined quantity that specifies the limit on the total depth of recursive instantiations ([implimits]), which could involve more than one template. The result of an infinite recursion in instantiation is undefined.} for this case can be interpreted to mean that such infinite recursion could cause runtime UB; however, this interpretation makes little sense as failure during template instantiation is fundamentally a compile-time issue. We therefore consider this case a wording bug rather than an instance of UB; this issue is currently being addressed by Core issue \cite{CWG3034}.

Finally, we exclude \emph{library undefined behaviour}. The natural mitigation approach for library UB is to make use of contract assertions (\tcode{pre}, \tcode{post}, and \tcode{contract_assert}) in library implementations and, where sensible, mandate such assertions through library hardening \cite{P3471R4}, both of which are out of scope for this paper. We, therefore, consider only UB that is specified in the core language part of the C++ working paper (Clauses 1--15). Further, we found one case of UB that is specified in the core language part of \cite{N5008} but actually represents a precondition on Standard Library functions;\footnote{[basic.start.term]/6: If there is a use of a standard library object or function not permitted within signal handlers ([support.runtime]) that does not happen before ([intro.multithread]) completion of destruction of objects with static storage duration and execution of \tcode{std::atexit} registered functions ([support.start.term]), the program has undefined behavior.}
that case is, therefore, also excluded from our list.

We found that all identified cases of core language UB can be classified into ten basic categories:

 \renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\Roman{enumi}.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Initialisation} --- 1 case. Evaluating an expression that produces an indeterminate value.
\item \textbf{Bounds} --- 5 cases. Using a pointer in a way that fails to respect the range of the pointed-to object or array. Examples: incrementing a pointer beyond the past-the-end position; performing single-object delete on an operand obtained from an array-new expression;  dereferencing a pointer returned from a request for zero size.
\item \textbf{Type and Lifetime} --- 51 cases. Operations that access storage and/or use pointers or references to storage in an inappropriate way that is not already covered by Initialisation and Bounds. Examples: attempting to access a value of one type through  a pointer of a different, incompatible type; attempting to access the value of an object after its lifetime has ended. 
\item \textbf{Arithmetic} --- 9 cases. Executing an arithmetic operation whose operands fail to meet certain preconditions. Examples: division by zero; conversion of a value to a different arithmetic type that cannot represent that value. 
\item \textbf{Threading} --- 1 case. Performing two concurrent accesses, at least one of which is modifying, to the same memory location from different threads where neither access happens before the other, i.e., a data race.
\item \textbf{Sequencing} --- 1 case. Performing two concurrent accesses, at least one of which is modifying, to the same memory location from the same thread where neither access is sequenced before the other.
\item \textbf{Assumptions} --- 1 case. Reaching an \tcode{[[assume]]} declaration whose operand would not evaluate to \tcode{true}.
\item \textbf{Control Flow} --- 5 cases. Errors in control flow. Examples: flowing off the end of a function; re-entering the same declaration recursively when initialising a static variable.
\item \textbf{Replacement Functions} --- 3 cases. Executing a user-defined replacement function (\tcode{operator new}/\tcode{delete}) that fails to meet the specified requirements. Examples: returning \tcode{null} from a user-defined placement \tcode{new}; throwing an exception from a user-defined \tcode{delete}.
\item \textbf{Coroutines} --- 3 cases. Misusing coroutine machinery. Examples: destroying a coroutine that is not suspended; failing to provide a \tcode{return_void} function for a coroutine that does not return a value.
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{piechart_categories} shows the distribution of the 80 identified cases of explicit core language UB across these ten basic categories. 



The categories of Initialisation, Bounds, and Type and Lifetime correspond to the common terms \emph{initialisation safety}, \emph{bounds safety}, \emph{type safety},  and \emph{lifetime safety}, respectively, and collectively represent UB that is commonly referred to with the umbrella term \emph{memory safety}. Much of the ongoing work around how to ``make C++ safe'' is focused on these  categories (see \cite{P3081R2}, \cite{P3700R0}, and references therein).

Because unambiguously categorising a particular case of UB into either \emph{type safety} or \emph{lifetime safety} is often impossible since it concerns both, we grouped them into a single combined category, Type and Lifetime. While some cases of UB are primarily caused by type aliasing and others are primarily caused by out-of-lifetime accesses, they form a spectrum, and many common operations in C++ (e.g., using a reference) rely on \emph{both} type and lifetime constraints to be satisfied.

Remarkably, these three categories related to memory safety account for 57 cases of UB, or 71.25\% of all identified cases; the Type and Lifetime category alone accounts for 51 cases of UB, or 63.75\% of all identified cases.

The next two categories, Arithmetic and Threading, correspond to the common terms \emph{arithmetic safety} and \emph{thread safety}, respectively; the latter contains only one case of UB, data races.

The following category, Sequencing, also contains just one case of UB: unsequenced operations, such as \mbox{\tcode{i++ + ++i}}. Classifying UB due to data races and unsequenced operations into two separate categories might seem surprising at first since they have a very similar same shape (except that one is inter-thread and the other is intra-thread), but as we will see in Section~\ref{strategy}, these two categories actually require very different approaches to mitigation.

The next category, Assumptions, also contains just one case of UB: reaching an \tcode{[[assume]]} declaration whose operand would not evaluate to \tcode{true}. As we will see later, this case of UB is of a different nature than the others and warrants its own category.

The final three categories (Control Flow, Replacement Functions, and Coroutines) contain a handful of cases of UB that are less frequently discussed in the current ``safe C++'' discourse.

\subsubsection{Relevance for security}

\cite{P3656R1} asks which cases of UB are security related. The paper suggests having security experts indicate which cases of UB have security impact and use ``always'', ``never'', and ``sometimes'' tags. We are not security experts, so we do not attempt to do this here. However, we note that cases of UB commonly associated with security vulnerabilities (see, for example, the CWE list at \url{https://cwe.mitre.org/}) fall into the Initialisation, Bounds, and Type and Lifetime categories. 

UB in other categories is not commonly exploited by malicious attackers to our knowledge. Nevertheless, some of these cases, for example those in categories Arithmetic and Threading, are a common source of program defects that do sizeable damage to existing software.

In principle, with aggressive optimising compilers any form of UB can lead to unpredictable defects and vulnerabilities. Mitigating cases of UB currently considered to be the most critical security concern will simply remove the easiest routes of attack from the table, and any UB not yet addressed may become the new major candidate for attackers to leverage for nefarious purposes.  Therefore, prioritising implementation based on current trends amongst malicious actors, though helpful, should not be used to limit the scope of our work on improving the C++ language specification (see \cite{Sutter2024}, \cite{P3500R1}, and \cite{P3578R0}).

\subsection{Diagnosability} 
\label{diagnose}

The second question \cite{P3656R1} asks is which cases of UB are ``efficiently locally diagnosable''. In this paper, we split this question into three separate questions: whether diagnosis can happen statically or whether it needs to happen dynamically (i.e., at run time), whether such diagnosis can be performed locally, and the runtime cost of such diagnosis (whether performed locally or not).

\subsubsection{Static vs. dynamic diagnosis}
\label{statically}

A commonly asked question is ``why does the committee not simply make all the UB ill-formed instead''? The answer is that in order for that to happen, it would be necessary to determine statically --- i.e., at compile time --- whether a given operation in a C++ program would lead to UB when executed at run time. However, whether a C++ program will have UB when executed is fundamentally a \emph{runtime} property, i.e., the answer depends on runtime values unknown at compile time (for example, the runtime value of a pointer or an integer). Therefore, in the vast majority of cases, such a compile-time determination cannot be made. In fact, in our entire list of 80 cases of UB, we cannot identify \emph{any} cases that can unconditionally be diagnosed at compile time.

Of course, static analysis is still useful and widely used in the field. There are many situations where static analysis \emph{can} detect a bug that would lead to UB when executed, because the relevant values or conditions happen to be known at compile time in the particular program at hand. However, given an existing C++ program, any approach based on static analysis fundamentally has to choose between \emph{false positives} (rejecting code for which no proof can be constructed one way or another, even if that code happens to be correct) and \emph{false negatives} (accepting incorrect code that will lead to UB when executed). 

Crucially, whether a pointer or reference refers to a valid object of the correct type within its lifetime at a given point in time (``memory safety''), the relevant property for addressing UB in the Initialisation, Bounds, and Type and Lifetime categories, seems to be fundamentally unprovable at compile time in the general case (see \cite{Baxter2024}).

As we will see in Section~\ref{strategy}, despite these fundamental limitations there are things we can (and should) do in the C++ Standard to enable static analysis to construct a proof in more cases, such as subsetting the language (\ref{subsetting}), providing replacement features (\ref{newfeatures}), and adding annotations (\ref{annotations}). However, for existing C++ programs, reliably detecting cases of UB without rejecting correct code will inevitably have to leverage \emph{runtime} detection, i.e., the insertion of additional runtime checks when compiling the program. We therefore focus on such runtime detection for the remainder of this analysis.

\subsubsection{Locality of diagnosis}
\label{locally}

An important property for diagnosis of UB is whether such diagnosis (whether static or dynamic) can be performed \emph{locally}, i.e. without keeping track of additional information across the entire program that is not available within the C++ abstract machine (achievable with additional instrumentation of the kind that is implemented in sanitisers, such as ASan and UBSan) and without analysing code in other branches (which is limited by the Halting problem) or on the other side of a function call boundary (which might be located in another TU and therefore inaccessible).

Most cases of UB in the Initialisation, Bounds, and Type and Lifetime categories are, in general, \emph{not} locally diagnosable. They could potentially be made locally diagnosable in the future with the introduction of novel features such as lifetime annotations \cite{P2771R1} or ``ghost data'' \cite{Lippincott2025} which are the subject of ongoing research. We discuss some of these approaches in Section~\ref{strategy}; here, we focus on the status quo in  Standard C++.

In the Bounds category, 
\{expr.add.out.of.bounds\} 
and \{expr.add.sub.diff.pointers\} 
are partially locally diagnosable (only if the array bound is statically known). In the Type and Lifetime category,
\{expr.static.cast.downcast.wrong.derived.type\},
\{expr.unary.dereference\}, 
\{conv.ptr.virtual.base\}, and
\{expr.dynamic.cast.lifetime\}
are partially locally diagnosable (for the null pointer case).
\{expr.mptr.oper.member.func.null\} is locally diagnosable because this case requires \emph{only} a null pointer check.
\{basic.align.object.alignment\} is locally diagnosable by checking the alignment of storage when creating an object at run time.
\{expr.assign.overlap\} is locally diagnosable by checking the overlap of the two address ranges. (The ranges are known because the address and \tcode{sizeof} are known at run time for both the source and the destination object.) \{class.abstract.pure.virtual\} is locally diagnosable by adding a runtime check to  the pure virtual function stub to which the base class vtable points. None of the other cases of UB in the Initialisation, Bounds, and Type and Lifetime categories are locally diagnosable.

All cases of UB in the Arithmetic category are locally diagnosable since they are all cases of an arithmetic operation producing a value that is somehow inappropriate (mathematically invalid, not representable in the target type, etc.) and that value can be inspected at run time.

UB in the Threading category (\{intro.races.data\}) is not locally diagnosable, but UB in the Sequencing category (\{intro.execution.unsequenced.modification\}) is. 

UB in the Assumption category (\{dcl.attr.assume.false\}) is, in principle, locally diagnosable by evaluating the operand of the assumption and verifying that the resulting value, contextually converted to \tcode{bool}, equals \tcode{true}. However, if that evaluation has any side effects, such a check could alter the observable state of the program. Therefore, even if the given assumption holds and no UB occurs, the check itself might render the program invalid by altering its state. Thus, this case of UB is  meaningfully diagnosable in any automated fashion only if the operand has no side effects when evaluated. However, proving that the operand has no side effects is generally impossible to do efficiently and is outright impossible in the presence of an opaque function call.

Two cases of UB in the Control Flow category are locally diagnosable. \{stmt.return.flow.off\} can be diagnosed by inserting a check at the end of every function body that does not end with a \tcode{return} statement. \{dcl.attr.noreturn.eventually.returns\} can be diagnosed by inserting a check into every function declared \tcode{[[noreturn]]}. The remaining three cases of UB in that category are not locally diagnosable.

Some cases of UB in the Replacement Function category are partially or fully locally diagnosable. In particular, some of the constraints specified in \{basic.stc.alloc.dealloc.constraint\} and \{expr.new.non.allocating.null\} are locally diagnosable, while others are not. In particular, we can check locally that a deallocation function does not exit via an exception and that an allocation function does not return null. However, checking the other constraints (locally or at all) is generally not possible.

Finally, one case of UB in the Coroutine category, {stmt.return.coroutine.flow.off\}, is locally diagnosable in a way analogous to \{stmt.return.flow.off\} by inserting a check at the end of a coroutine for which no \tcode{return_void} function is provided. The remaining two cases of UB in that category are not locally diagnosable since being so would require tracking runtime state information that is not currently maintained within the coroutine handle in most implementations. 

Overall, as shown in Figure~\ref{piechart_locally}, only 18 cases of UB (22.5\% of all cases) are unconditionally locally diagnosable at run time, while 58 cases of UB (72.5\%) are not; these cases require instrumentation of the code in order to be diagnosed at run time. We will discuss these requirements in more detail in Section~\ref{cost_nonlocal}.

\subsubsection{Cost of local diagnosis}
\label{cost_local}

Considering locally checkable cases of UB separately from non-locally checkable ones is useful to estimate the cost of diagnosis. For locally diagnosable cases, some kind of runtime check --- an \emph{assertion} --- could be inserted by the implementation and then evaluated at run time. The total cost of diagnosis is, therefore, equal to the cost of evaluating that check multiplied by the number of times the check needs to be evaluated.

Note that in this paper, we study the theoretical, relative cost based on the current specification of the C++ language. We do not, however, measure the actual cost in existing tooling that implements such checks, nor do we present benchmarks in this paper; such studies are left for future work.

That said, the cheapest kind of check --- and the only one that has (almost) no overhead for the happy path --- is the ``fail if you get here'' check, equivalent to a \tcode{pre}/\tcode{post}/\tcode{contract_assert(false)}. This kind of check is sufficient to diagnose \{class.abstract.pure.virtual\}, \{stmt.return.flow.off\}, \{stmt.return.coroutine.flow.off\}, and \{dcl.attr.noreturn.eventually.returns\}.

A slightly more expensive but still cheap and optimiser-friendly kind of check is a null check, required to diagnose the null pointer cases  
(\{expr.static.cast.downcast.wrong.derived.type\},
\{expr.unary.deref\-erence\},
\{conv.ptr.virtual.base\},
\{expr.dynamic.cast.lifetime\}, 
\{expr.mptr.oper.member.\linebreak[3]func.null\}, and
\{expr.new.non.allocating.null\})
as well as division by zero (\{expr.mul.div.by.zero\}).

Integer comparisons are similarly cheap and optimiser-friendly and are   required for bounds checks with statically known array bounds
(\{expr.add.out.of.bounds\} and
\{expr.add.sub.diff.pointers\})
as well as for \{expr.shift.neg.and.width\} 
and \{intro.execution.unsequenced.modification\}.

Beyond this, a number of UB cases can still be checked by a straightforward arithmetic expression but with increasingly expensive expressions: \{expr.assign.overlap\} requires computing whether two integer ranges overlap, and  \{basic.align.object.alignment\} requires computing an integer modulo. 

At the expensive end of the locally diagnosable UB spectrum are runtime checks for which there is no corresponding C++ expression; instead, the compiler would have to generate more complex ``magic'' checks based on knowledge unavailable in the C++ abstract machine. In particular, this case applies to all arithmetic UB except \{expr.add.out.of.bounds\} and
\{expr.add.sub.diff.pointers\}. The compiler would have to validate the bit patterns of values of arithmetic types according to knowledge it has about how values of such types are represented on the targeted platform. Such checks can be done locally, but they can slow operations involving built-in types and, in particular, floating-point types.

In addition to the cost of the check itself, we need to consider the frequency with which these checks would need to be done. Checks that would need to happen once when a function is called or when a function returns are likely to be acceptable in most scenarios. Extensive checks for arithmetic UB will probably be acceptable in fewer scenarios because such checks have the potential to significantly slow arithmetic operations, which are performance sensitive in many contexts. On the extreme end, if we wanted to diagnose \{intro.execution.unsequenced.modification\} via a runtime check, the check itself would be fairly inexpensive, but the compiler would have to identify all potential read operations that are not sequenced with respect to each given write operation and then insert checks to identify if those operations are actually going to reference the same address.

\subsubsection{Cost of non-local diagnosis}
\label{cost_nonlocal}

For UB that is not locally diagnosable (which is most of the UB in C++), we need to consider the cost of the required additional instrumentation. To get an idea of that cost, we must nail down exactly which additional properties that are not normally known from within the C++ abstract machine would need to be tracked by such instrumentation. This tracking would need to happen at run time throughout the \emph{entire} program; checks relying on the tracked information would have to be inserted for \emph{every} runtime operation that may be affected by such UB.
The full list is available in \hyperref[appendix]{Appendix~A}; we provide an overview below.

To diagnose \emph{all} cases of UB in the memory safety categories of Initialization, Bounds, and Type and Lifetime, instrumentation would have to track all the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
\item Provenance of all pointers and pointers-to-member
\item For all storage, whether it has been allocated or freed
\item For all storage, whether it has been initialised
\item For all storage, whether it has been created such that it can hold implicit lifetime objects
\item For all storage, the type of the object associated with it (if any), including whether it is \tcode{const} or \tcode{volatile}
\item For all objects, whether their lifetime has been started or ended
\item For all objects, whether they are currently being constructed or destroyed
\item The dynamic type of all \emph{non}-polymorphic objects of class type
\item For all references, whether they have been initialized
\item For all addresses that point to  functions, the type of the function
\end{itemize}

To diagnose UB in the Threading category, instrumentation would have to track, for \emph{all} memory accesses, from which threads that memory is accessed and when these accesses synchronise with each other. Doing this exhaustively is not practically possible; however, instrumentation that is capable of diagnosing a subset of cases exists in the form of sanitisers (TSan).

The non-locally-diagnosable UB in the Control Flow category concerns operations that are not allowed during construction and destruction of objects with static or thread-local storage duration (\{basic.start.main.exit.during.destruction\} and \{basic.start.term.use.after.destruction\}). To diagnose these, instrumentation would have to insert guards tracking whether such objects are currently being constructed and destroyed.  

Finally, to diagnose \{dcl.fct.def. coroutine. resume.not. suspended\} and \{{dcl.fct.def.
coroutine.destroy.not.suspended}\} in the Coroutine category, instrumentation would have to track the suspension state associated with every coroutine handle.

As we know from existing sanitisers, such instrumentation is expensive enough that it is almost never affordable in production. If we were to add instrumentation covering \emph{all} of the above, we would remove vast swathes of UB from the language, but performance would worsen by an order of magnitude, unless special hardware-acceleration or some other radically new technology for these checks becomes available.

Given the substantial overhead of such instrumentation in both runtime cost and additional memory consumption, the cost of the actual checks themselves (whether a specific pointer is valid at a specific time, etc.) is not particularly important for non-local diagnosis because the performance penalty would be dominated by the instrumentation overhead.

\subsection{Existence of replacement behaviour}
\label{replacement}


For existing code that cannot be modified in-source, removing runtime UB requires redefining 
the semantics of the affected C++ operations, for the cases where UB would occur today, to have well-defined behaviour instead. A useful question is therefore: for which cases of UB is it actually possible to  specify such well-defined \emph{replacement behaviour} in a meaningful way?

For the purposes of this analysis, we need to be careful with delineating what exactly we mean by replacement behaviour. If it is possible to insert a runtime check guarding a particular case of UB (e.g., a bounds check, a null pointer check), we can specify well-defined behaviour for the case when this check fails (e.g., terminate the program, throw an exception) which guarantees that we never actually execute the operation that would have runtime UB, thus avoiding it. However, that does not mean giving well-defined behaviour to the operation \emph{itself}. What we mean by replacement behaviour is that, regardless of the existence of the check, continuing execution and evaluating the operation no longer leads to runtime UB \emph{even if the check failed, or would have failed}.

As we will discuss in more detail in Section~\ref{strategy}, we can conceptually distinguish between two types of replacement behaviour --- \emph{refined} and \emph{erroneous} behaviour --- depending on whether the replacement behaviour is considered correct or incorrect (despite no longer being undefined). In any case, for either type of replacement behaviour to actually happen, the compiler must be able to lay down the necessary instructions at compile time. Simultaneously, as discussed in Section~\ref{statically}, in the vast majority of cases core language UB is fundamentally \emph{not} diagnosable at compile time, as whether or not the UB will occur depends on runtime parameters. Replacement behaviour can therefore not depend on knowing that an error occurred. For non-locally-diagnosable UB, replacement behaviour also cannot depend on any additional instrumentation being present.

For this paper, we systematically identified all cases of core language UB for which either form of replacement behaviour can be meaningfully defined. This section gives an overview; the full list can be found in \hyperref[appendix]{Appendix~A}. As we will see, for most cases of UB, replacement behaviour does not exist, and if it does, it is often not cheap.

For UB in the Initialization category (\{basic.indet.value\}), replacement behaviour is sometimes possible for built-in types: an operation that would currently return an indeterminate value can be specified to return \emph{some} value instead.


We could consider returning a specific value such as 0, or returning some unspecified value (as a form of refined behaviour). However, doing so removes the ability for tools to recognise that a program defect is present (see \cite{P2754R0}). The most meaningful option is to make it return an erroneous value (a form of erroneous behaviour). For variables with automatic storage duration, this replacement behaviour is already part of C++26 as EB via \cite{P2795R5} because for this case, the replacement behaviour is particularly cheap. The same  behaviour could also be employed for dynamically allocated variables but at greater cost (see \cite{P2723R1} Section 6 for discussion).

On the other hand, producing an erroneous value (instead of, for example, the value that happened to be in memory where an object was incorrectly presumed to have been initialised) requires having a point in time where a fallback value can be unconditionally placed in memory, such as when passing the declaration of an automatic variable; there are cases where such a point cannot be determined.

Further, we cannot in general define replacement behaviour for uninitialised variables of user-defined type. Even if we could zero out all the underlying storage for user-defined types (or overwrite it with some other known bit pattern), doing so does not always produce, for that type, a valid value that can be accessed without UB. (Consider a user-defined type that relies on a member pointer always being dereferenceable.) Therefore, \{basic.indet.value\} does not have replacement behaviour for the general case.



Practically \emph{none} of the UB in the categories of Bounds and Type and Lifetime have any plausible replacement behaviour. The only exception is \{conv.lval.valid.representation\}: if the bits in the value representation of an object of built-in type are not valid for that type, the compiler could instead coerce the value into an erroneous value.\footnote{This property of \{conv.lval.valid.representation\} is a potential argument for placing this case of UB into the Arithmetic category instead of the Type and Lifetime category as we did here.} For example, in the code example given in the C++ working paper,



\begin{codeblock}
bool f() {
  bool b = true;
  char c = 42;
  memcpy(&b, &c, 1);
  return b;         // undefined behavior if \tcode{42} is not a valid value representation for \tcode{bool}
}
\end{codeblock}



the UB could be replaced by well-defined behaviour by appropriately bit-masking every accessed \tcode{bool} value (and considering the result erroneous if the bit-mask operation changed the value). Similar mitigations could be put in place for other built-in types since the space of allowed bit representations for values of those types, for the targeted platform, are known to the compiler. The caveat is that such mitigations would potentially incur a significant performance overhead on many simple operations that involve built-in types.

All UB in the Arithmetic category has the same possible replacement behaviour: if an arithmetic operation would produce an inappropriate value, it can be coerced into some other value instead. We could contemplate refined behaviour in the form of a concrete value (e.g., saturate or wraparound for signed integer overflow, choose the closest valid value for invalid conversions) or erroneous behaviour in the form of an erroneous value being produced. In either case, such replacement behaviour will incur significant performance overhead on common arithmetic operations.

Defining replacement behaviour for UB in the Threading category (\{intro.races.data\}) is in principle possible: we could make all primitive memory accesses implicitly atomic, as in the Java memory model. The overhead incurred by such a model will heavily depend on the memory model of the underlying hardware; on weakly-ordered platforms, such as ARM,
it will be larger than on strongly-ordered platforms such as x86. Note that while such replacement behaviour is well-defined, it still fails to prevent many real bugs that result from incorrect application of concurrency since user-defined types with multiple members can still be easily observed with inconsistent (``torn'') states if no proper synchronisation is performed.


The replacement behaviour for UB in the Sequencing category (\{intro.execution.unsequenced.modifica\-tion\}) is much more straightforward: we can define that the unsequenced operations happen in some unspecified order. This behaviour can still have performance overhead in the form of losing  optimisation opportunities, but such overhead will likely be manageable. 


The replacement behaviour for UB in the Assumption category (\{dcl.attr.assume.false\}) is trivial: just ignore the assumption, instead of optimising based on it. The performance overhead is limited to losing any optimisation opportunities from placing the assumption there. Of course, this mitigation makes the assumption itself completely useless. We will discuss this case in more detail in Section~\ref{assume}.

Finally, we can define partial replacement behaviour for one cases of UB in the Control Flow category  (\{stmt.return.flow.off\}) and an analogous case of UB in the Coroutines category (\{stmt.return.coroutine.flow.off\}): when the function or coroutine would return a value of built-in type, we can define that flowing off the end returns an erroneous value. This case is effectively handled in the same way as \{basic.indet.value\}; again, no plausible replacement behaviour exists for user-defined return types in the general case.

Overall, as shown in Figure~\ref{piechart_replacement}, we can define meaningful replacement behaviour for only 16 cases of UB (20\% of all cases). In addition, in 3 cases, this is only possible when the operation in question produces a value of built-in type. Unconditional replacement behaviour exists for only 13 cases of UB (16.25\% of all cases). In all of these cases, the replacement behaviour consists of erroneous behaviour; in most cases, removing the UB in this manner introduces significant runtime cost.

\section{Strategy}
\label{strategy}

Having performed an in-depth analysis of all explicit core language UB in the C++ working paper in Section~\ref{analysis}, we can use the results of this analysis to develop a holistic strategy for systematically detecting, mitigating, and ultimately removing UB across the entire C++ programming language specification. Our goal is for this strategy to guide the development of the core language UB white paper \cite{P3656R1} as well as future versions of Standard C++.

The outline of this strategy is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig_magicslide}, an updated version of the diagram on slide 53 in \cite{P3754R0} (a.k.a. the ``magic slide'') that we presented to EWG in Sofia and that EWG approved as a basis for the core language UB white paper.

\subsection{Overview}

The proposed strategy is composed of seven basic tools that are orthogonal to each other: feature removal, refined behaviour, erroneous behaviour, insertion of runtime checks, language subsetting, the introduction of annotations, and the introduction of entirely new language features. In section~\ref{tools}, we describe each tool and discuss which cases of UB identified in this paper it can be applied to.

Three of these tools (refined behaviour, erroneous behaviour, and runtime checks) have the interesting property that they are applicable even in cases where the source code cannot be modified for whatever reason, and thus can be used to remove UB from existing legacy C++ programs.

Further, in order to be usable effectively in practice, three of these tools (erroneous behaviour, runtime checks, and language subsetting) need to be configurable by the user, either via compiler options or directly in source. This design space is discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{config}.

Finally, several of the available tools overlap in scope with \emph{Profiles}, another proposed feature currently in development. A discussion of how Profiles might fit into our proposed strategy can be found in Section~\ref{profiles}.

\subsection{Scope}

Our proposed strategy for removal of explicit core language UB focuses on tools that can be portably specified within the C++ abstract machine. We therefore do not consider, in this paper, efforts that operate largely outside of the C++ abstract machine and the specification tools afforded by the C++ Standard. One noteworthy effort that falls into the latter category is  \cite{P3627R0}, which proposes a profile for preventing remote code execution (RCE) by employing implementation-defined techniques such as stack isolation and address space layout randomisation (ASLR).

Further, as discussed in \cite{P3700R0}, making C++ ``safe''\footnote{In this paper, we avoid unqualified uses of the terms ``safe'' and ``safety'' because of their ambiguity. As discussed in \cite{P3376R0}, \cite{P3500R1}, and \cite{P3578R0}, it is critically important to distinguish between conflicting usages of those terms, such as functional safety, language safety, memory safety, etc.} consists of more than mitigating explicit core language UB. We already touched upon implicit UB and language UB in Section~\ref{enum_scope}. Beyond those, there are many other classes of bugs unrelated to UB that can compromise the functional safety, security, and correctness of a C++ program. Such bugs include resource leaks, termination errors, and logic errors. 

While there are tools available to address these classes of bugs (for example, logic errors can often be avoided by using strongly typed utilities such as \cite{P3045R6}), and there is interesting ongoing work in those areas, they are out of scope for the strategy proposed here. At least for now, we explicitly target the core language UB white paper \cite{P3656R1} and therefore limit the scope of the strategy described here to explicit core language UB. 

\subsection{Tools}
\label{tools}

\subsubsection{Feature removal}
\label{removal}

The first and most blunt tool in our toolbox is to make a C++ operation that would otherwise lead to runtime UB unconditionally ill-formed, i.e., to remove it from the language --- either immediately or via a deprecate-remove cycle spanning multiple releases of the C++ Standard.

However, we generally do not consider it acceptable to break an existing, \emph{correct} program by using this tool (or any of the other proposed tools). If we want to strictly follow this principle, usage of the removal tool would have to be restricted to cases where we can determine at compile time that the given operation will definitely have UB when executed.\footnote{One could argue that even then, the program is not necessarily incorrect unless that operation actually ends up being executed at run time. This is not something a C++ compiler can reason about unless the operation in question is either lexically inside \tcode{main} or is provably being called from \tcode{main}.} As discussed above in Section~\ref{statically}, there is not a single case of UB in our list where such a determination can generally be made.

A slightly less conservative approach is to unconditionally remove a feature if we can determine at compile time that it always \emph{either} causes UB \emph{or} does nothing useful. This removal can happen in a single step; alternatively, a language construct can first be deprecated, and then removed in a later Standard. Historically, the committee has been very wary of acting on such deprecations if there is a belief that the code broken by a removal will be frequent, especially if the downside of the bad construct is not generally catastrophic. In general, even breaking incorrect code such that it would fail to compile can make the cost of migrating a large codebase to a new C++ standard unbearably high if the problematic code is ubiquitous and its negative impact often benign.  

A current example of using this tool is the proposal \cite{P3424R0}. When a deallocation function (i.e., a user-defined \tcode{delete} operator) exits via an exception, the behaviour is currently undefined. Therefore, a throwing or potentially-throwing exception specification on such a deallocation function always either causes UB (if an exception ends up being thrown from it) or does nothing useful (if no such exception is ever being thrown). The paper proposes to deprecate deallocation functions with an explicit non-throwing \emph{noexcept-specifier} and making deallocation functions with a potentially-throwing \emph{noexcept-specifier} ill-formed.

We are currently not aware of any other areas in the C++ Standard where this tool could be successfully applied, but it is worth keeping it in our toolbox in case such areas will be discovered in the future, and committing to the slow but effective process of deprecating prior to removal when the end result is meaningfully improved.

\subsubsection{Refined behaviour}
\label{refined}

Some cases of UB can be addressed by unconditionally changing their runtime semantics to some well-defined behaviour. We have extensively used this option in the past to gradually remove UB from the language; examples of successfully applying this tool in the C++ Standard are the introduction of implicit lifetime types in C++20 \cite{P0593R6} which gave defined behaviour to certain situations when a pointer to raw allocated memory is being cast to a pointer of object type, as well as the range-based for loop fix in C++23 \cite{P2644R1},  which extended the lifetime of certain temporary objects across the duration of executing the loop, thus avoiding UB due to dangling references. 

We expect that there are relatively few remaining situations in the C++ working paper where this tool can be used effectively. To avoid creating language dialects, refined behaviour needs to be unconditional. For example, GCC has an option \tcode{-fwrapv} which turns signed integer overflow into wraparound. We cannot make that the new behaviour of signed integer addition unconditionally for two reasons. First, the associated runtime overhead would be unacceptable for many users; and second, in many cases the result will still be incorrect but this new behaviour would mask the bug, making it more difficult for users and tools to diagnose it. We also cannot have two different language dialects where the same expression means two different things (overflow or wraparound).  In such cases, another tool is more appropriate --- erroneous behaviour (see next section).

\subsubsection{Erroneous behaviour}
\label{erroneous}

Some cases of UB can be addressed by replacing it with well-defined replacement behaviour, but specifying that replacement behaviour as \emph{erroneous}, that is, well-defined but still considered incorrect. The purpose of introducing erroneous behaviour is to not remove the bug, and to leave tools with the possibility of diagnosing it, but at the same time to place a limit on the program behaviour in the face of the bug and in particular to prevent the bug from creating a security vulnerability.

Unlike refined behaviour, it is acceptable to specify erroneous behaviour in a way that is relatively vague (e.g., return \emph{some} erroneous value rather than return a specific value), as it represents an incorrect program that cannot be relied on. For the same reason, it makes sense to make erroneous behaviour configurable (see Section~\ref{config}). Indeed, the definition of erroneous behaviour adopted for C++26 via \cite{P2795R5} permits different possible behaviours.

Together with that definition, we also adopted one instance of erroneous behaviour for C++26: producing an erroneous value (instead of exhibiting undefined behaviour) when reading a default-initialised automatic variable of arithmetic type \cite{P2795R5}. Beyond that one instance, \cite{P2795R5} contains a section with a tentative list of other cases of UB that could be replaced with erroneous behaviour, and \cite{P2973R0} proposes to do so for erroneous behaviour for missing return from assignment.

In this paper, we go further and propose to introduce erroneous behaviour for \emph{all} cases for which we identified in Section~\ref{replacement} that some kind of plausible well-defined replacement behaviour exists --- 13 cases unconditionally plus 3 cases for built-in types only. In Sections~\ref{design} and \ref{wording} of this paper, we provide a concrete specification for how to perform the necessary replacements in the C++ working paper; the full list of proposed erroneous behaviours is provided in \hyperref[appendix]{Appendix~A}.

\subsubsection{Runtime checks}
\label{checks}

As we saw in Section~\ref{diagnose}, the large majority of UB (76 cases out of 80) can in principle be diagnosed by inserting and performing a suitable runtime check. The check verifies the conditions necessary for the operation in question to have well-defined behaviour at run time. It also acts as a guard against UB: if the check fails, the program can be terminated, thus preventing the undefined behaviour from occurring.

While such runtime checks invariably add runtime overhead, they are very effective at both diagnosing bugs and removing security vulnerabilities. In Sections~\ref{design} and \ref{wording} of this paper, we propose a generic framework for systematically adding runtime checks to C++ core language constructs via implicit contract assertions.

Implicitly generated runtime checks are widely deployed in the field today. Checks that can be generated locally by the compiler are often provided via compiler flags, for example the \tcode{-ftrapv} flag in GCC that checks for signed integer overflow and terminates the program on failure. Checks that require additional instrumentation to perform are provided by various flavours of sanitisers such as ASan, UBSan, etc.

In order to be widely deployable, runtime checks --- whether they are user-authored assertions, compiler-generated checks guarding against UB, or any other form of correctness check that is redundant in a correct program and has non-negligible overhead --- need to be configurable; this is discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{config}.

\subsubsection{Language subsetting}
\label{subsetting}

While practically no C++ operation can, in the general case, be proven at compile time to exhibit UB at run time, there are a number of operations that are particularly prone to exhibiting UB at run time when not used correctly; such operations are colloquially known as ``unsafe''. Examples of such operations are C-style casts (which can silently fall back to \tcode{reinterpret_cast}) and pointer arithmetics. Compilers and linters already provide options to statically flag the usage of such features as a potential source of bugs. We could go one step further and make such constructs ill-formed, particularly if there are ``safer'' alternative features that provide equivalent functionality. 

However, in such cases, we cannot make these constructs \emph{unconditionally} ill-formed, as this would break a significant number of correct C++ programs deployed in the field. Therefore, we need to use a tool different from simple removal (Section~\ref{removal}). The required tool is called \emph{language subsetting}: specifying named \emph{subsets} of the C++ language that do not contain the ``unsafe'' features. This tool can be very effective for avoiding UB in codebases that can be modernised or are being newly written. However, because much of existing C++ code cannot be changed easily, subsetting needs to be opt-in. Thus, it is the third tool in our toolbox that needs to be configurable by the user (see Section~\ref{config}).

While we do not propose a concrete specification for language subsetting in this paper, such a specification is being developed in \cite{P3716R0}. As described in that paper, a number of principles need to be considered for designing this tool correctly: subsetting the language should never be allowed to alter the semantics of well-formed code, subsets must always combine orthogonally, and so forth. 

\subsubsection{Annotations}
\label{annotations}

Some cases of UB can be mitigated by language-level annotations that provide additional information that can be propagated across the interface boundaries of a C++ program. Such information can turn cases of UB that are \emph{not} locally diagnosable (which is the majority of UB today, see Section~\ref{diagnose}) into cases that \emph{are} locally diagnosable.

An example of a standard proposal in this area are the lifetime annotations proposed in \cite{P2771R1}. An example of such annotations deployed in the field as non-standard vendor extensions is the \tcode{__counted_by} attribute introduced in Clang 18. This attribute allows the user to propagate information about array bounds to enable automatic out-of-bounds checks. Such attributes are a great example for how different tools that form the proposed strategy, while being usable independently from each other, can also work together to help each other cover even more cases of UB.

\subsubsection{New features}
\label{newfeatures}

Finally, some cases of UB can be addressed by providing entirely new language features that provide functionality equivalent to that of existing ``unsafe'' features but without the possibility of UB. Examples of such proposals are \tcode{std::saturate_cast} \cite{P0543R3} (approved for C++26), enabling conversion from one integer type to another without the danger of UB due to values not representable in the target type, and borrow checking \cite{P3390R0}, a memory-safe alternative to pointers and references based on the Rust borrow checker.

Note that combining the new features tool with the language subsetting tool is equivalent to the approach encouraged by Bjarne Stroustrup, ``superset then subset'' (see \cite{P3650R0} and references therein).

\subsection{Configuration}
\label{config}

Three of the seven tools discussed above need to be \emph{configurable} by the user in order to be usable in practice: runtime checks, erroneous behaviour, and language subsetting.

Runtime checks with non-negligible overhead, in order to be widely deployable, necessarily need to be configurable in several ways; this is discussed in much detail in \cite{P2899R1} and references therein. As we saw in Section~\ref{diagnose}, the majority of UB in C++ today is not locally diagnosable and requires expensive sanitiser-like instrumentation to perform the checks. Even for those 18 cases of UB that are locally diagnosable and do not require additional instrumentation to insert runtime checks, in most cases the checks themselves will have a significant --- and in some cases, unacceptable --- runtime overhead. Since correctness checks serve no purpose in a program known to be correct --- or for use cases where correctness is not the overriding concern ---  there needs to be an option to turn the checks off to avoid the overhead. This option is offered by every assertion facility that we know of. 

Further, the behaviour of a failed check needs to be configurable as well. In some scenarios, the most appropriate behaviour following a failed check is immediate termination; in others, termination is unacceptable even in the face of bugs. In some scenarios, it is desirable to have detailed diagnostics describing the failure; in others, the overhead of generating such diagnostics is undesirable.

Similar reasons apply to erroneous behaviour: in practically all cases, its introduction comes with non-negligible --- and in some cases, even very large --- performance overhead. Therefore, to avoid unacceptable performance regressions in existing, correct C++ code, we \emph{must} offer an escape hatch that reverts to today's ``unsafe'' semantics. One such escape hatch is the \tcode{[[indeterminate]]} attribute for uninitialised values. Such a syntactic escape hatch is not applicable for all cases; we propose a generic escape hatch for erroneous behaviour that does not require syntax in  Section~\ref{assume}.

Finally, as already discussed in Section~\ref{subsetting}, language subsetting needs to be opt-in in order to avoid breaking existing, correct C++ programs.

For all these features, we need to clearly specify the available configuration options and the mechanisms available for the user to select these options at different levels of granularity. For erroneous behaviour and runtime checks, we accomplish this via leveraging contract evaluation semantics (see Section~\ref{design}); in-source configuration of these evaluation semantics at arbitrary granularity can be achieved with Labels (see Section~\ref{labels}). For subsetting, the design of suitable configuration mechanisms are not yet well understood; we expect future papers to make progress in this area.

Another proposed feature in this space is \emph{Profiles}. We can distinguish between individual profiles --- collections of rules that aim to provide a guarantee that a C++ program exhibit certain qualities (e.g., \cite{P3081R2}, \cite{P3038R0}, \cite{P3402R3}, and \cite{P3446R0}) --- and the \emph{Profiles framework} \cite{P3589R2}, a set of mechanisms to enable and disable a named profile at various levels of granularity.

There is no consensus yet on how Profiles relate to and compose with other proposals such as the holistic strategy for removing UB from C++ proposed here. That said, most Profiles proposed so far consist of some combination of specifying subsets of the language (Section~\ref{subsetting}), defining replacement behaviour for UB (Section~\ref{erroneous}), and/or introducing runtime checks guarding against UB (Section~\ref{checks}). It therefore seems logical to define Profiles as a higher-level feature building on top of these three basic tools (see Figure~\ref{fig_magicslide}). Given that these three features are configurable, a concrete profile could be defined as being a named configuration preset for these features. 

For example, we may define a language subset that excludes pointer arithmetics, and a set of implicit runtime checks for array bounds checking; further, the user may define explicit contract assertions on their own functions and declare them as bounds checks. We can then define a ``bounds'' profile whose purpose it is to allow the user to opt into all three of these features at once. Such profiles can be tailored to particular problem areas of the language, such as type, bounds, or arithmetic safety profiles, or to particular regulatory requirements, such as a MISRA profile. If we pursue such a ``multi-level'' strategy, we must make it clear which feature is responsible for providing the user-facing configuration mechanism for which tool (see also Section~\ref{labels}).

\section{Proposed design}
\label{design}

In this section, we propose a framework that systematically introduces runtime checks and well-defined replacement behaviour --- two of the tools that form the strategy presented in Section~\ref{strategy} --- to the C++ Standard. Runtime checks guarding against core language UB are realised as \emph{implicit contract assertions}, leveraging the foundation laid by Contracts as adopted for C++26; in addition, replacement behaviour is added instead of UB wherever meaningfully possible. Both features are controlled and configured via the evaluation semantics introduced by \cite{P2900R14}.

\subsection{Defining implicit contract assertions}
\label{defineicas}

The initial subset of Contracts functionality added to C++26 via \cite{P2900R14} contains three kinds of \emph{contract assertions}: \tcode{pre}, \tcode{post}, and \tcode{contract_assert}. Since these contract assertions are specified by the user with explicit syntax, in this paper we call them \emph{explicit} contract assertions. For example, the author of a vector-like class can add a precondition assertion to its subscript operator to guard against out-of-bounds access:

\begin{codeblock}
T& operator[] (size_t index)
  pre (index < size());
\end{codeblock}

The precondition assertion \tcode{pre (index < size())} can be evaluated with a checked assertion  (\emph{observe}, \emph{enforce}, or \emph{quick-enforce}), which allows the user to opt into defined behaviour --- program termination and/or a call to a contract-violation handler --- when their vector is accessed out of bounds. Further, the contract-violation handler can be replaced by the user, allowing them to query information about the error and implement their own mitigation strategy. Alternatively, the user can opt out of the runtime check by choosing an unchecked evaluation semantic (\emph{ignore}) if their use case requires it.

To implement runtime checks that guard against core language UB, we propose to introduce \emph{implicit contract assertions}, which are added implicitly by the implementation, rather than explicitly by the user. In all other aspects, they work exactly the same as explicit contract assertions.

As an example, let us consider indexing into a plain array rather than a user-defined, vector-like class. Let us further assume for the purpose of this example that the size \tcode{N} of this array is statically known:

\begin{codeblock}
int main() {
  int a[10] = { 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 };
  std::size_t i; 
  std::cin >> i;
  return a[i];
}
\end{codeblock}

In C++ today, the behaviour of this program is undefined if the value of \tcode{i} is not smaller than 10 (\{expr.add.out.of.bounds\}). However, instead of saying that out-of-bounds access into a plain array is UB, we can say that access into a plain array has an \emph{implicit precondition assertion} that the index is not out of bounds. Then, the program behaves as-if the compiler had wrapped every raw array subscript operation for which it statically knows the array bound \tcode{N} into an inline function with a precondition assertion:

\begin{codeblock}
template <typename T, std::size_t N>
T& __index_into_array(T (&a)[N], std::size_t i) 
pre (i < N) {
  return *(&a + i);
}
\end{codeblock}

Other than being an implicit precondition assertion automatically generated by the compiler, \mbox{\tcode{pre (i < N)}} behaves the same as an explicit precondition assertion. That is, the user has the same choice of four evaluation semantics (\emph{ignore}, \emph{observe}, \emph{enforce}, or \emph{quick-enforce}) to specify the desired behaviour depending on the tradeoffs that are most suitable for their application. When an out-of-bounds access is detected and the semantic is \emph{observe} or \emph{enforce}, the same contract-violation handler is called that is used for explicit contract assertions.

\subsection{Applying implicit contract assertions}
\label{applyicas}

Having specified precisely what an implicit contract assertion is and how it behaves, we can now apply that specification to \emph{every} case of UB  that is --- at least in principle --- checkable at run time. As we saw in Section~\ref{analysis}, this is true for 76 cases, that is, 95\% of all identified cases of explicit core language UB in C++.

This feat can be accomplished by applying the following transformation across the entire C++ Standard: change every occurrence of “if $A$ is not \tcode{true}, operation $X$ has undefined behaviour'' to ``operation $X$ has an implicit precondition that $A$ is \tcode{true}; continuing execution past a violation of this precondition is undefined behaviour''.

Note that we specify no restrictions on the evaluation semantics of any of these 76 newly introduced  implicit contract assertions. Since the choice of evaluation semantic is implementation-defined, each implementation can choose which evaluation semantics to offer for which one and which should be the default semantic. One possible implementation choice is to simply make all 76 cases always have the \emph{ignore} semantic; it follows that all existing implementations of C++ are already conforming with this wording transformation. Another possible choice is to say that  \emph{ignore} is the default, but other semantics are available for some checks. Yet another possible choice is to enable certain checks by default, for example ones that are particularly security-relevant and/or have a particularly small runtime overhead. All those choices are conforming with our proposal.

Since the choice of evaluation semantic is implementation-defined, implementations are further expected to document which semantics they support for which implicit contract assertions and which selection mechanism they offer. Once we have Labels (see Section~\ref{labels}) for each case of UB guarded by an implicit contract assertion, implementations and users can refer to each case by name, giving us a shared, portable, universally agreed upon standard framework with terminology for reasoning about runtime UB.

Many possible choices for the evaluation semantics of implicit contract assertions map directly to existing compiler and sanitiser options. For example, for signed integer overflow, the GCC flag \tcode{-ftrapw} is a conforming implementation of the \emph{quick-enforce} semantic; sanitisers like ASan and UBSan are conforming implementations of the \emph{enforce} semantic for those cases of UB that they identify. These tools can continue to work in the way they do; however, bringing them into the scope of the C++ Standard as proposed here has the benefit that they can now integrate with the same unified standard contract-violation handling facility, significantly increasing the ability to deploy software to production systems that is hardened against entire categories of potential bugs.

Today, the integration between such tools and user code tends to be poor. For example, all Clang sanitisers have a callback, \tcode{__sanitizer_set_death_callback}, but this callback takes no arguments. It can be used to inform us that the process is about to terminate, but it does not provide an API to programmatically query what happened or where. ASan has a slightly more sophisticated callback, \tcode{__asan_set_error_report_callback}, which takes a single argument of type \tcode{const char*}. This argument provides a string that contains the generated error report. With our proposal, all these tools can instead hook into the standard contract-violation-handling API. This API provides not only a user callback in the form of a  program-wide replaceable contract-violation handler, but also programmatically accessible information about the defect via the  \mbox{\tcode{contract_violation}} object passed into the contract-violation handler. This more comprehensive API can serve as a uniform, standard callback mechanism for sanitisers and other tools.
% TD: So here's a subtlety that I don't know how to resolve. This was one of the reasons P3229 was voted down, and something that Ville kept whinging about. It turns out that current sanitiser implementations that call their own callbacks are NOT conforming with this proposal. You could argue that they simply don't support a user-defined contract-violation handler, only a default contract-violation handler that in turn calls the existing callback. However, this would then also preclude supporting a user-defined contract violation handler for P2900 pre/post/contract_assert: in our current wording, the contract-violation is either replaceable or not. There is no "we use the user-defined one for some assertions but the default one for others". Do you have any idea how we could resolve this? It's a problem for motivating this paper.

Further, coding guidelines can place restrictions on which evaluation semantics are permitted for which kinds of implicit contract assertions; our proposal provides the necessary standard terminology for this. For example, in a safety-critical context, a set of coding guidelines may prescribe that unchecked semantics may not be used for certain kinds of implicit contract assertions, and a matching profile could render configurations that do not conform with this requirement ill-formed (see Section~\ref{profiles}). Thus, the usage of toolchains and compiler options that could lead to the program exhibiting a particular kind of UB could be prevented by construction. Of course, this option requires alternatives to exist that offer checked semantics for the associated implicit contract assertions with acceptable performance tradeoffs.

Finally, applying implicit contract assertions throughout the language in the proposed fashion addresses another much-discussed issue: \emph{explicit} contract assertions in C++26, as specified in \cite{P2900R14}, can themselves have UB when checked because explicit contract-assertion predicates are boolean expressions and thus follow the usual rules for evaluating expressions in C++. This property has been repeatedly raised as a concern (see \cite{P2680R1}, \cite{P3173R0}, \cite{P3285R0}, and \cite{P3362R0}).

The approach suggested in those papers is to constrain explicit contract-assertion predicates to expressions that can be statically proven to have no UB. However, this approach does not seem to be specifiable, implementable, or usable in practice (see  \cite{P3376R0}, \cite{P3386R0}, and \cite{P3499R1}) and has repeatedly been rejected by SG21, SG23, and EWG. What \emph{does} work is to specify a framework for mitigating UB across the entire language, as proposed here. Once we have this framework, it will then automatically also apply to the evaluation of explicit contract assertions.

\subsection{Defining replacement behaviour}
\label{specifyeb}
The next part of our proposal is to introduce well-defined replacement behaviour for all 16 cases of core language UB for which such replacement behaviour exists (see Section~\ref{replacement}). We accomplish this by modifying the specification of each affected operation as follows. If a condition that would have previously made the behaviour of the operation undefined (i.e., an implicit contract violation) occurs, and control flow continues past that violation (because the associated check was evaluated with the \emph{ignore} or \emph{observe} semantic), then the behaviour of the operation is defined to be that replacement behaviour instead of UB. Consider the following example:
\begin{codeblock}
int g(int i) {
  return i + 100;
}
\end{codeblock}
This function returns the result of adding two signed integers, which may or may not exhibit UB depending on whether the addition will overflow --- which is unknown at compile time as one of the integers in question is a runtime parameter of the function.

This program now behaves as-if the compiler performed every signed integer addition with a built-in \tcode{operator+} that is guarded by an implicit precondition assertion against overflow, \emph{and} whose implicitly defined function body always has well-defined behaviour as follows:
\begin{codeblock}
int operator+(int a, int b)
pre ((b >= 0 && a <= INT_MAX - b) || (b < 0 && a >= INT_MIN - b)) {  
  // return the result of the addition or an erroneous value
}
\end{codeblock}
The fact that this implicit function body always has well-defined behaviour is the major difference between cases where meaningful replacement behaviour exists (such as this one), and cases where it does not (such as array subscripting).

The wording transformation required to implement the above replacement across the entire C++ Standard is to change every occurrence of “if $A$ is not \tcode{true}, operation $X$ has undefined behaviour'' to ``operation $X$ has an implicit precondition that $A$ is \tcode{true}; if this precondition is violated, the behaviour is \emph{<replacement behaviour>}''.

In all 16 cases identified in this paper, this replacement behaviour will be some form of erroneous behaviour. For data races, the erroneous behaviour consists of performing all primitive memory accesses atomically in some unspecified order; 
% TD: I have trouble fitting data races into this framework. What would the implicit contract assertion look like for data races? I can't figure out how to formulate the UB condition as an assertion. It doesn't "feel" like an assertion. It doesn't help that I don't have a clue how TSan actually implements it.
for unsequenced operations, it consists of performing the operations in question in sone unspecified order; for assumptions, it consists of ignoring the assumption; for all remaining cases, it consists of returning an erroneous value (which is only possible in cases where the operation in question returns a value of built-in type).

\subsection{Providing an escape hatch}
\label{assume}

As discussed in Section~\ref{replacement}, if we apply the transformation describe in the previous section and do nothing further, we introduce significant --- and in many cases, unacceptable --- performance regressions to existing code. Therefore, we must offer an escape hatch to users that reverts to today's semantics: a violation of the implicit precondition leads to runtime UB.

For erroneous behaviour that arises from reading an indeterminate value, \cite{P2795R5} introduced a semantic escape hatch specific for this case: the \tcode{[[indeterminate]]} attribute. However, in many cases, such a syntactic escape hatch is simply nonviable. Consider, for example, arbitrary arithmetic expressions where some integer operations may overflow; where would we place a syntactic escape hatch for a certain arithmetic operation within that expression? Instead, we need a \emph{generic} escape hatch that works for all cases and does not require syntax.

Further, this escape hatch needs to be flexible enough that implementations can choose whether or not it should be engaged by default. Engaging the escape hatch by default seems counterintuitive because doing so would fail to provide a ``safe default''; however, in some cases, it will be necessary as defaulting to the well-defined replacement behaviour and silently incurring the associated runtime overhead would be too user-hostile.

As it turns out, such a generic, nonsyntactic escape hatch that reverts to today's semantics --- a violation of the implicit precondition leads to UB --- is nothing other than a new, fifth evaluation semantic in addition to the four existing ones (\emph{ignore}, \emph{observe}, \emph{enforce}, \emph{quick-enforce}) that can be applied to the evaluation of the affected implicit contract assertions. This evaluation semantic is called the \emph{assume} semantic.

Just like the \emph{ignore} semantic, the \emph{assume} semantic is a \emph{nonchecking} semantic; i.e., its predicate is not evaluated. Further, just like with the \emph{ignore} semantic, if the predicate evaluates to \tcode{true} at the point where the contract assertion is placed, the \emph{assume} semantic has no effect; i.e., the program behaves exactly as if the contract assertion were not there. However, unlike the \emph{ignore} semantic, if the predicate does \emph{not} evaluate to \tcode{true}, the behaviour is undefined. This semantic allows compilers to optimise on the assumption that the predicate is \tcode{true}, just like they do today for those cases of core language UB.

With this definition, we can map all five evaluation semantics for implicit contract assertions that guard against core language UB to concrete behaviours. For example, for signed integer overflow, this mapping is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The GCC compiler option \tcode{-ftrapv}, which aborts the program on signed integer overflow, is a conforming implementation of the \emph{quick_enforce} semantic.
\item A sanitiser that detects signed integer overflow and prints a diagnostic is a conforming
implementation of the \emph{enforce} or \emph{observe} semantic (depending on whether the
process is terminated or execution continues after printing the diagnostic).
\item The GCC compiler option \tcode{-fwrapv}, which implements wraparound for signed integer addition using twos-complement representation, is a conforming implementation of the \emph{ignore} semantic,  silently executing well-defined replacement behaviour.
\item The default behaviour in C++ today, which is to assume that signed integer addition never overflows and to optimise based on this assumption when the appropriate optimisation flags are selected by the user, is a conforming implementation of the \emph{assume} semantic.
\end{itemize}
Just like with all other evaluation semantics, the mechanism by which the \emph{assume} semantic is selected is implementation-defined and will, in practice, be accomplished by vendor-provided compiler flags. In addition, Labels (see Section~\ref{labels_sema}) will provide the ability to choose and constrain the evaluation semantic in code with arbitrary granularity.

Importantly, in light of the sustained opposition in EWG to allowing the \emph{assume} semantic for \emph{explicit} contract assertions (\tcode{pre}, \tcode{post}, and \tcode{contract_assert}), we propose that the \emph{assume} semantic is allowed for only \emph{implicit} contract assertions. Explicit contract assertions may \emph{not} be evaluated with the \emph{assume} semantic (see also Section~\ref{labels_assume}).

This restriction is important because, for explicit contract assertions, the \emph{assume} semantic  has the potential to silently add UB to an otherwise correct program if used incorrectly. This risk does not exist for implicit contract assertions since they are generated by the compiler;  in all of those cases, the \emph{assume} semantic is merely a backwards-compatibility tool to achieve the same semantics that those operations already have in C++ today.

Note that this set of five evaluation semantics has the interesting property that it provides a single mechanism to configure two different tools in our toolbox simultaneously: the replacement behaviour as well as the associated implicit contract assertion.

\subsection{Interaction with \tcode{noexcept}}

Consider:
\begin{codeblock}
bool f() {
  int x;
  return noexcept(x + 1);
}
\end{codeblock}
In C++ today, calling \tcode{f()} has defined behaviour (the indeterminate value is never accessed; the operand of \tcode{noexcept} is an unevaluated operand) and returns \tcode{true} (adding two integers can never throw an exception unless the behaviour is undefined). If we want to avoid breaking changes to the existing language, the result of the \tcode{noexcept} operator must remain the same with this proposal.

However, since \tcode{x} has an erroneous value, evaluating \tcode{x + 1} may call the contract violation handler, which in turn may throw an exception. With our proposal, it is therefore no longer true that evaluating the core language expression \tcode{x + 1} can never throw an exception unless UB occurs due to signed integer overflow.

A detailed discussion of this problem can be found in \cite{P3541R1}. Fundamentally, in order to address this problem, we need to choose between the following three options: either accept the breaking change to the \tcode{noexcept} operator, or do not allow throwing violation handlers for implicit contract assertions,\footnote{As a variation of this option, \cite{P3577R0} proposes that the \emph{default} contract-violation handler should be normatively prohibited from exiting via an exception, however a \emph{user-defined} contract-violation handler is still free to do so. However, this paper did not get consensus in SG21 or EWG.} or redefine the meaning of the \tcode{noexcept} operator to be ``can never throw an exception \emph{unless there is a contract violation}''. 

SG21 discussed this problem at great length. The first option introduces unacceptable breaking changes to existing C++ programs. The second option precludes unwinding the stack in response to a contract violation, which is not expected to be a very common strategy, but has important use cases (see \cite{P3318R0}). SG21 therefore concluded that the only acceptable solution is the third one. 

For the proposal in this paper, we follow the SG21 consensus. It is therefore possible for an implicit contract assertion to call a throwing contract-violation handler when violated, and for the evaluation of the expression to exit via that exception, even if the \tcode{noexcept} operator returns \tcode{true} for that expression.

\subsection{Extending the library API}
\label{library}

To give the user a way to programmatically distinguish explicit and implicit contract assertions in the contract-violation handler, we propose to add a new enum value, \tcode{implicit}, to the enum \mbox{\tcode{assertion_kind}}. We simply append the new enumerator to the existing ones, which gives it the numerical value \tcode{4}, without attaching any particular meaning to that numerical value.

Alternatively, we could define its numerical value to be \tcode{0} since that value is not yet taken; however, we prefer to avoid using \tcode{0} and thus to retain the ability to detect the case in which the enum has not been explicitly initialised with a valid value.\footnote{See also \cite{P3227R0}, which was adopted into \cite{P2900R14} and made the same argument for adding new enumerators to the enumeration \tcode{evaluation_semantic}.}

No other changes to the library API for contract-violation handling are necessary. In particular, unlike earlier revisions of this paper and unlike \cite{P3081R1}, which adopted its library API from those earlier revisions, we no longer propose to add new enumerators to the enumeration \mbox{\tcode{detection_mode}} to encode the category of error (Initialization, Bounds, and so on); instead, this encoding can be accomplished more effectively and flexibly via Labels (see Section~\ref{labels_cat}).

Further, we propose no changes to the specification of \tcode{comment()} and \tcode{location()}. C++26 non-normatively recommends that these functions return a textual representation of the expression that triggered the contract violation and the source location of the contract violation, respectively. While returning such a representation is, in principle, possible for violations of implicit contract assertions, generating a textual representation for every expression in the program that could lead to UB is likely to cause an unacceptable amount of code bloat. However, generating some other string that may help us identify the problem, such as the diagnostic message already printed by existing sanitisers, is equally conforming, as is simply returning an empty string and a default-constructed source location if no information is available or if the information cannot be made programmatically accessible in the contract-violation handler (for example,
because it is located in a separate debug information file). 

Finally, we do not propose a separate contract-violation handler for implicit contract assertions. Having a single, program-wide handler for all contract violations is a central aspect of the \cite{P2900R14} design. By standardising on a central reporting mechanism, we clearly separate the responsibility for reporting from the responsibility of knowing all the different mechanisms within a program by which a bug might be detected. For example, the user might want to hard-code a particular form of termination or to use a particular logger. Forcing the user to repeat these things in multiple places is poor design. A user who wishes to use a different handler for implicit contract assertions can always branch on the \tcode{assertion_kind} in the global contract-violation handler and dispatch to a custom handler from there.


\section{Proposed wording}
\label{wording}

The proposed wording is relative to the current C++ working paper, \cite{N5008}.

Modify [basic.contract.general] as follows:

\end{note}
\end{adjustwidth}

Modify [basic.contract.eval] as follows:

\begin{adjustwidth}{0.5cm}{0.5cm}
An evaluation of a contract assertion uses one of the following \added{five}\removed{four} evaluation semantics: 
\added{\emph{assume,}}

It is implementation-defined which evaluation semantic is used for any given evaluation of a contract assertion. \added{Explicit contract assertions are never evaluated with the assume semantic.}

Add a new section, [basic.contract.implicit] after [basic.contract.eval]:

\begin{adjustwidth}{0.5cm}{0.5cm}
\added{A built-in operation $O$ may have an \emph{implicit precondition assertion} $C$ applied to it. If so,

\section{Future extensions}
\label{labels}

We already briefly touched upon Labels in earlier sections of this paper. Here, we explore other exten\-sions that rely on Labels as proposed in \cite{P3400R1} and provide important additional functionality for implicit contract assertions not proposed in this paper.

\subsection{Identifying the UB category}
\label{labels_cat}

\cite{P3400R1} proposes the addition of \emph{identification labels} to contract assertions. These identification labels can be used to identify groups of contract assertions by name. For explicit contract assertions, we must introduce these identification labels manually; however, for implicit contract assertions, we can define and assign such identification labels directly in the C++ Standard (see \cite{P3400R1} Section 2.2.8). Such implicitly defined identification labels would make possible programmatically identifying, in the contract-violation handler, whether the violated implicit contract assertion  is related to an out-of-bounds issue, an arithmetic issue, and so forth; for example:

\begin{codeblock}
void handle_contract_violation(const std::contracts::contract_violation& violation)
{
  if (auto* bounds_label =
      violation.getLabel<std::contracts::labels::bounds_label>()) {
      // handle violation of assertion labelled with the bounds label
  }
}
\end{codeblock} 

% TD: This is actually a lot less readable than the previous `detection_mode` version:
%
% void handle_contract_violation(const std::contracts::contract_violation& violation)
% {
%   if (violation.detection_mode() == bounds) {
%       // handle violation of assertion labelled with the bounds label
%   }
% }
%
% I understand why labels are more generic/flexible but it could be a hard sell since the end-user code tends to look ugly & verbose.

Notably, the \cite{P3400R1} approach has an important advantage over using the \tcode{detection_mode} enum, as proposed in \cite{P3081R1} and in earlier versions of this paper: a single implicit contract assertion can belong to multiple groups. We identified cases of UB, such as \{expr.dynamic.cast.glvalue.lifetime\}, that are simultaneously type and lifetime issues.

In addition, users (and, more importantly, libraries) can use such labels to annotate their own explicit contract assertions, enabling the same policies to guide handling of core language bounds violations and violations of higher-level functions. For example, the indexing operator of a user-defined container (such as the one shown in Section~\ref{defineicas}) can have an explicit precondition labelled to belong to the same Bounds category as bounds checks defined by the C++ Standard itself. The same identification labels can be defined for hardened preconditions in the C++ Standard Library.

\subsection{Granular control of the evaluation semantic}
\label{labels_sema}

Another important feature enabled by Labels is the possibility to control and constrain the evaluation semantic in code. This possibility also extends to implicit contract assertions (see \cite{P3400R1} Section 2.2.8). Any possible label, such as ``always enforce'', ``never enforce'', etc., can be applied to any group of implicit contract assertions at any granularity: per file, per TU, per module, per namespace, per function, or per code block:

\begin{codeblock}
int f(int a, int b) {
  contract_assert implicit arithmetic |= always_enforce;
  return a + b;
}
\end{codeblock}

In addition to labels that specify or constrain the evaluation semantics directly, there are labels that give the user higher-level control of the evaluation semantics based on meaningful decisions, for example an ``audit'' label to identify expensive checks.

Labels used in this way provide granular control when needed, allow the Standard to
specify useful groupings of different sources of program defects, and give developers the freedom they
need to control mitigations for those defects based on exactly the criteria needed for their environments.

Such a control mechanism for runtime checks (or for other tools in our toolbox such as language subsetting) needs to be designed carefully and take into account the overall strategy (Figure~\ref{magicslide}). In particular, we need to make it clear which feature is responsible for providing the user-facing configuration mechanism for which tool, and avoid ending up in a situation where the same functionality is provided simultaneously by different features in incompatible ways.

For granular, in-source control of the evaluation semantics of implicit contract assertions, we need to agree whether this happens via directives such as the ones proposed in  \cite{P3400R1} and shown here, or by using the syntax proposed in the Profiles framework as proposed in \cite{P3589R2}. If we want to have both, we need to specify one in terms of the other to avoid an incoherent and messy design. 

If we follow the idea in Section~\ref{config} and consider Profiles to be a higher-level feature defined in terms of the seven basic tools (the low-level features), then a Profile that enables or disables runtime checks can be defined as essentially a declaration that expands to \cite{P3400R1} directives as the one shown above. Alternatively, we could design Profiles as an auditing feature rather than a configuration feature: instead of actively enabling certain configuration options, the effect of a Profile would be that the  program is ill-formed if the configuration options chosen via  \cite{P3400R1} directives or other mechanisms are not compatible with the guarantees that that Profile ensures.

\subsection{Integrating assertions and assumptions}
\label{labels_assume}

In Section~\ref{assume}, we introduced the \emph{assume} semantic as a backwards-compatibility escape hatch for newly introduced erroneous behaviour; as such, it can only apply to implicit contract assertions, not to explicit ones.

Allowing the \emph{assume} semantic on explicit contract assertions has met sustained opposition in EWG due to the possibility of inadvertently \emph{adding} new UB to a C++ program instead of removing it. The presence of the \emph{assume} semantic in the C++2a Contracts proposal \cite{P0542R5} contributed to that proposal being removed from the C++20 Working Draft. In response to this opposition, no \emph{assume} semantic was included in C++26 Contracts \cite{P2900R14}. Assumptions were instead standardised as a separate feature in the form of the \tcode{[[assume]]} attribute \cite{P1774R8} to enable the required functionality.

However, Labels, as proposed in \cite{P3400R1}, open up the possibility of introducing an explicit label that would allow the \emph{assume} semantic to apply to an explicit contract assertion as well. Consider the limiter example from \cite{P1774R8}:
\begin{codeblock}
void limiter(float* data, size_t size) {
  [[assume(size > 0)]];
  [[assume(size % 32 == 0)]];
  // implementation
}
\end{codeblock}

With a \tcode{may_be_assumed} label, we could instead write:
\begin{codeblock}
void limiter(float* data, size_t size)
  pre<may_be_assumed> (size > 0);
  pre<may_be_assumed> (size % 32 == 0);
\end{codeblock}
Now, the assumptions are not only visible on the \emph{declaration} of the function, but also benefit from all other features of explicit precondition assertions, such as the ability to select evaluation semantics other than \emph{assume}.

To avoid the possibility of introducing an assumption by accident, the \emph{assume} semantic would be allowed on explicit contract assertions only when the \mbox{\tcode{may_be_assumed}} label is present; further, a ``safe C++'' profile could make such a label ill-formed. Thus, contract assertions without the explicit label would be no less ``safe'' than they are in C++26.

Such a label would be a vast improvement over today's \tcode{[[assume]]} attribute since it would allow for \emph{checkable} assumptions (see \cite{P2064R0} for context), achieving the integration between assertions and assumptions that we failed to achieve in the C++20 cycle. The \tcode{[[assume]]} attribute --- a temporary solution that was introduced as a reaction to that failure --- could then be deprecated.
